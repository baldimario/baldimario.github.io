# Juniority

In the wonderful world of workplaces, there's a phenomenon I like to call `Juniority` or `Junior by Seniority`.
It's that peculiar breed of person who somehow manages to have all the trappings of seniority—titles, privileges, and a knack for basking in the limelight when the sun is shining—but, deep down, they are juniors in disguise.

You know the type.
They’re the first to jump to the front row for recognition when the team nails a big project.
They’re ready to "own" a situation... as long as that situation involves smooth sailing and a clear weather forecast.
But the moment the seas get rough—when a real leader needs to steer the ship through chaos—they channel their inner Captain Schettino, abandon ship, and leave the rest of us clinging to driftwood.

It's tragic, it's comic, and frankly, it's exhausting.
Leadership isn’t about posing for the photo op at the helm; it’s about staying there when the waves are crashing and the storm is raging.

So, here’s a toast to the real captains out there—the ones who shoulder responsibility when the going gets tough, not just when the champagne is flowing. And to the `senior juniors`? Bon voyage. May you find calmer waters (and perhaps a better disguise).

P.S. If you're reading this and thinking, "Wow, this sounds like me," I assure you... it does.
